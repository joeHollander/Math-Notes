## Notes & Journal System üìù

1.  **Proof Journal**
    * Write 1 full problem solution daily (AMC or STEP).
    * Include: problem, clean solution, and strategic reflection.
    * Tag entries by topic (e.g., Geometry, Inequalities).
2.  **Error Log**
    * Record every missed problem: source, topic, mistake type, and correct solution.
    * Review weekly to identify patterns or conceptual gaps.
3.  **Concept Notes**
    * Organize notes by subject: Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory, Combinatorics.
    * Include key theorems, techniques, and example problems.
    * Use highlighting to differentiate formulas, strategies, and common pitfalls.

## How to Find AMC Problems by Topic üîç

1.  **AoPS Wiki**
    * Use the AoPS Wiki to browse topics and sample problems.
2.  **AoPS Problem Search Tool**
    * Use the AoPS Problem Search to filter by contest, topic, and question range (e.g., Geometry, AMC 12, Q15‚Äì25).
3.  **Alcumus & AoPS Books**
    * Alcumus offers adaptive topic-based AMC practice.
    * Use end-of-chapter problems from AoPS books, tagging by topic if needed.
