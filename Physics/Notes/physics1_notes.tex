\section*{Forces and Newton's Laws}
\begin{itemize} 
    \item \textbf{Intertia} is a property of matter, 
and is the resistance to a change in motion (acceleration),
or a tendency to maintain a state of motion. 
Acceleration is any change is speed or direction.

    \item \textbf{Force} is any push or pull on an object (contact or non-contact).
    \item \textbf{Net Force} is the combination of, or the sum of, all simultaneous forces.
    \item \textbf{Dynamics} considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems. 
    \item \textbf{Magnetism} is the magnetic force between two wires carrying electric current. 
\end{itemize}

Newton's first law, the law of inertia, states that an object at rest will remain at rest, 
and an object in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
The inertia of an object is measured by its mass. 

Newton's second law can first be considered as a proportion between acceleration and net force: 
\[
\mathbf{a \propto F_{net}}, 
\]
and the proportion between acceleration and mass:
\[
\mathbf{a} \propto \frac{1}{m}.
\]
Combining the proportionalities gives the equation form of Newton's second law:
\[
\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathbf{F_{net}}}{m}, 
\]
or
\[
\mathbf{F_{net}} = m\mathbf{a}.
\]

Newton's third law, sometimes called the law of action/reaction, states that whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, 
the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude opposite in dirction to the force that it exerts.
Rephrased, all contact forces are interactions.
